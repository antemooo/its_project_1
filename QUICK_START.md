# 🚀 Quick Start Guide for Students

> **New to C#?** This guide will help you get started with your project in 15 minutes!

## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Install .NET 8 SDK
Visit: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0

**Check installation:**
```bash
dotnet --version
```
Should show: `8.0.x` or higher

### 2. Choose Your Project

Pick **ONE** project based on your interest:

| Project | Best For | Difficulty | Main Concepts |
|---------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **SciCalc** | Math lovers | ⭐ Easy | Interfaces, Factory Pattern |
| **CinemaApp** | Business logic fans | ⭐⭐ Medium | Records, Algorithms, Booking |
| **TrafficSim** | Algorithm enthusiasts | ⭐⭐⭐ Hard | State Machines, Graphs, Dijkstra |

**Recommendation**: Start with **SciCalc** if this is your first C# project!

### 3. Run the Project

```bash
# Navigate to your chosen project
cd SciCalc        # or CinemaApp or TrafficSim

# Run it!
dotnet run --project src/Program.cs
```

🎉 **Success!** You should see the application start.

## 📖 Understanding the Structure (2 minutes)

Every project follows this pattern:

```
YourProject/
├── src/                  # ALL your code goes here
│   ├── Models/           # Data classes (Vehicle, Movie, etc.)
│   ├── Services/         # Logic classes (Calculator, Planner)
│   └── Program.cs        # Starts everything (has Main method)
├── data/                 # Example files and test data
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

### What goes where?

**Models/** = "What things exist?"
- Example: `Vehicle`, `Movie`, `Room`, `Show`
- These are usually simple data containers
- Think: **nouns**

**Services/** = "What can we do?"
- Example: `Calculator`, `OperationFactory`, `MarathonPlanner`
- These contain your business logic
- Think: **verbs**

---

## 🎯 Your First Task (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Read the Examples
```bash
# From your project folder
cat data/examples.txt    # Mac/Linux
type data\examples.txt   # Windows
```

### Step 2: Try Some Commands

**For SciCalc:**
```
> add 5 3 2
10

> mode deg
> sin 30
0.5

> help
(shows all commands)
```

**For CinemaApp:**
```
> add-room "Room A" 100
> add-movie "Inception" 02:28
> list-shows 2025-11-01
```

**For TrafficSim:**
```
> path 0 0 2 2
(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)
```

### Step 3: Read ONE File

Pick a simple file to understand:
- **SciCalc**: `src/Services/Operations/Add.cs`
- **CinemaApp**: `src/Models/Movie.cs`
- **TrafficSim**: `src/Models/Vehicle.cs`

**Look for:**
- ✅ XML comments (`///`) explaining what it does
- ✅ Inline comments explaining WHY
- ✅ Pattern labels (FACTORY, STRATEGY, etc.)

## 💡 First Feature Ideas

### SciCalc - Easy Additions:
1. **Add `abs` operation** (absolute value)
   - File: `src/Services/Operations/Abs.cs`
   - Formula: Returns positive version of number
   
2. **Add `max` operation** (find maximum)
   - File: `src/Services/Operations/Max.cs`
   - Use: `max 5 2 9 1` → `9`

3. **Add calculation history**
   - Store last 10 results
   - New command: `history`

### CinemaApp - Easy Additions:
1. **Add room capacity check**
   - Show warning if room is 80%+ booked
   
2. **Add movie genre**
   - Extend `Movie` record with genre
   - Filter shows by genre

3. **Add customer names to bookings**
   - Track who booked which seats

### TrafficSim - Easy Additions:
1. **Add vehicle status command**
   - Show current location of all vehicles
   
2. **Add traffic statistics**
   - Average travel time
   - Number of vehicles at each crossroad

3. **Add visualization**
   - Print ASCII grid showing vehicle positions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "dotnet: command not found"
**Solution**: Install .NET 8 SDK from microsoft.com

### Problem: "Build FAILED"
**Solutions**:
1. Check for syntax errors (missing semicolons, brackets)
2. Run `dotnet clean` then `dotnet build`
3. Check that all `using` statements are correct
4. Verify file is in correct namespace

### Problem: "Could not find Program.cs"
**Solution**: You're in wrong directory. Use `cd` to navigate:
```bash
cd SciCalc              # Go into project
cd src                  # Go into src folder
cd ..                   # Go back up one level
pwd                     # Show current directory
```

### Problem: "Namespace not found"
**Solution**: Add `using` statement at top of file:
```csharp
using SciCalc.Models;
using SciCalc.Services;
```

### Problem: "Interface not implemented"
**Solution**: Make sure your class has ALL methods from interface:
```csharp
// Interface says:
public interface IOperation {
    string Name { get; }
    double Evaluate(params double[] args);
}

// Your class must have BOTH:
public class MyOp : IOperation {
    public string Name => "myop";  // ✅ Has Name
    public double Evaluate(...) { } // ✅ Has Evaluate
}
```

## 📚 Learning Resources

### C# Basics
- **Microsoft C# Tutorial**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/
- **C# Syntax Cheatsheet**: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-sharp/modules/csharp-hello-world/cheatsheet

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Objects doing the same task differently
- **Factory Pattern**: One place creates all objects
- **Repository Pattern**: Hide how data is stored

### Useful C# Features in This Project
- `record`: Immutable data class with auto-equality
- `params`: Accept variable number of arguments
- `??`: Null-coalescing operator (provide default)
- `?.`: Null-conditional operator (safe access)
- `=>`: Expression-bodied members (shorthand)

   - Start with `Program.cs` (entry point)
   - Follow the flow from there
   - Understand what calls what

2. **Comment As You Go**
   - If you figured something out, write it down
   - Future you will thank present you

3. **Test After Every Change**
   - Don't write 100 lines then test
   - Test every 5-10 lines
   - Catch bugs early

4. **Use `Console.WriteLine()` for Debugging**
   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine($"Debug: value = {myValue}");
   ```

5. **Ask Questions**
   - Use course forum
   - Attend office hours
   - Study with classmates

6. **Start Small**
   - Better to finish 80% well than 100% poorly
   - Get basics working first
   - Add extras if time permits
