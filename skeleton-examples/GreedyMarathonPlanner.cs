    /// üìù PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
    /// Given a list of shows (each with start and end time), select the
    /// maximum number of shows that don't overlap. A "Marathon Ticket"
    /// means watching as many movies as possible in one day.
    /// 
    /// üìö ALGORITHM: Greedy Interval Scheduling
    /// 
    /// The key insight: Always pick the show that ends EARLIEST.
    /// Why? It leaves the most time for future shows.

    /// Theorem: Greedy choice is optimal.

    /// Proof idea:
    /// 1. Suppose optimal solution O exists that differs from greedy G
    /// 2. Let f‚ÇÅ be first show in O, g‚ÇÅ be first show in G
    /// 3. Since G picks earliest-ending, g‚ÇÅ.end ‚â§ f‚ÇÅ.end
    /// 4. We can replace f‚ÇÅ with g‚ÇÅ in O without conflicts

    /// 6. By induction, G is optimal

    /// Step 2: Sort by end time (use LINQ OrderBy)
    ///   var sorted = relevantShows.OrderBy(s => s.EndTime);
    /// 
    /// Step 3: Initialize result and tracking variables
    ///   List<Show> result = new();
    ///   DateTime lastEndTime = DateTime.MinValue;

    /// Step 4: Loop through sorted shows

    /// Step 5: Check overlap and add if no conflict

/*
 * üéì LEARNING NOTES:
 * 
 * Why Greedy Works Here (But Not Always):
 * 
 * Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices hoping for global optimum.
 * They DON'T always work! But for interval scheduling, greedy IS optimal.
 * 
 * Key insight: Picking earliest-ending show ALWAYS leaves maximum room
 * for future selections. No other choice could possibly be better.
 * 
 * Counter-example where greedy fails:
 * - Knapsack problem: Picking highest value/weight ratio isn't always optimal
 * - You need Dynamic Programming for knapsack!
 * 
 * Related Problems:
 * 1. Weighted interval scheduling ‚Üí Use Dynamic Programming (see bonus!)
 * 2. Room/machine scheduling ‚Üí Same greedy algorithm works
 * 3. Activity selection ‚Üí Classic greedy algorithm application
 * 
 * Real-World Applications:
 * - Conference scheduling (meeting rooms)
 * - CPU task scheduling
 * - Classroom assignment
 * - TV program selection
 * - Flight scheduling
 * 
 * Alternative Approaches (Don't use these, but good to know):
 * 1. Brute force: Try all 2^n subsets ‚Üí O(2^n) time, way too slow!
 * 2. Dynamic Programming: Overkill for unweighted case, use for weighted
 * 3. Branch and bound: More complex, no benefit here
 * 
 * Pattern Recognition:
 * When you see "maximum number of non-overlapping" ‚Üí Think GREEDY
 * When you see "maximum value/weight" ‚Üí Think DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
 * 
 * Bonus Challenge (After completing this):
 * See docs/dp-marathon-bonus.md for weighted interval scheduling!
 * What if each show has a different ticket price and we want max total value?
