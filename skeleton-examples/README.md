//
// ‚≠ê DIFFICULTY: 1-5 stars
// ‚è±Ô∏è ESTIMATED TIME: Hours needed
//
// üß™ TEST CASES:
//   Input ‚Üí Expected output
//==============================================================================

using ...;

namespace ...;

/// <summary>
/// Class description
/// </summary>
public class ClassName
{
    /// <summary>
    /// ==================== STUDENT TODO ====================
    /// Implementation instructions
    /// 
    /// üìù REQUIREMENTS:
    /// What needs to be implemented
    /// 
    /// üí° HINTS:

## üéØ How to Use These Templates

### For Instructors Converting Files:

1. **Choose similar file from examples**
   - Simple operation? Use Add.cs pattern
   - Business logic class? Use Show.cs pattern
   - Complex algorithm? Use GreedyMarathonPlanner.cs pattern

2. **Copy annotation structure**
   - File header with metadata
   - TODO comment format
   - Learning notes at bottom

3. **Adjust guidance level**
   - Simple files: Less hints
   - Complex files: More hints
   - Match difficulty to guidance

4. **Test comprehensiveness**
   - Can student understand task from TODO alone?
   - Are hints helpful but not solutions?
   - Do test cases cover edge cases?

### For Students Learning:

1. **Read entire file first** (don't skip to TODO!)
   - Understand class purpose
   - Note learning objectives
   - Check prerequisites
   - Review test cases

2. **Plan before coding**
   - Read requirements carefully
   - Understand algorithm (if applicable)
   - Sketch out approach
   - Ask questions if confused

3. **Implement step by step**
   - Follow numbered steps in TODO
   - Use hints when stuck
   - Test frequently
   - Refactor after working

4. **Verify with test cases**
   - Run all provided test cases
   - Test edge cases
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Ensure correctness

## üìà Progression Through Examples

### Learning Path:

**Stage 1: Simple (Add.cs)**
- Goal: Get comfortable with skeleton format
- Focus: Basic C# and LINQ
- Success: Complete in < 20 minutes

**Stage 2: Medium (Show.cs)**
- Goal: Design more complex classes
- Focus: OOP principles, validation
- Success: All methods working, tests passing

**Stage 3: Complex (GreedyMarathonPlanner.cs)**
- Goal: Implement non-trivial algorithms
- Focus: Algorithm analysis, correctness
- Success: Understand WHY it works, not just HOW

## üß™ Testing Your Skeletons

After converting a file, verify:

### Compilation Test:
```bash
dotnet build
# Should succeed even with NotImplementedException
```

### Structure Test:
- [ ] Has file header with metadata?
- [ ] Has learning objectives?
- [ ] Has difficulty and time estimate?
- [ ] Has test cases?

### TODO Test:
- [ ] Are requirements clear?
- [ ] Are hints helpful but not complete?
- [ ] Is step-by-step guide provided?
- [ ] Are common mistakes noted?

### Student Test:
- [ ] Give to 1-2 students
- [ ] Can they understand the task?
- [ ] Are hints sufficient?
- [ ] Is time estimate accurate?

---

## üí° Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Provide complete pseudocode for complex algorithms  
‚úÖ Show multiple solution approaches  
‚úÖ Link to external resources  
‚úÖ Explain WHY, not just HOW  
‚úÖ Include complexity analysis  
‚úÖ Note common pitfalls  
‚úÖ Give realistic time estimates  

### DON'T:
‚ùå Give complete implementation  
‚ùå Use vague hints ("just think about it")  
‚ùå Omit test cases  
‚ùå Skip error handling guidance  
‚ùå Forget to explain design decisions  
‚ùå Assume prior knowledge  

---

## üîÑ Maintenance

### After Each Semester:

1. **Collect feedback**
   - Which hints were most helpful?
   - Which parts were confusing?
   - Were time estimates accurate?

2. **Update accordingly**
   - Clarify confusing TODOs
   - Add missing hints
   - Adjust time estimates
   - Add new test cases

3. **Keep examples fresh**
   - Update to latest C# features
   - Refresh external links
   - Add new learning notes

‚úÖ **Students can finish** (sufficient guidance)  
‚úÖ **Students understand deeply** (learning notes)  
‚úÖ **Students can verify correctness** (test cases)
